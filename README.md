# Cybernix Frontend Security Challenge 🧠

This React app intentionally includes several **security vulnerabilities** for candidates to identify and fix during a live technical interview.

## 🚀 Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## ⏱️ Task
You have 10–20 minutes to:
- Find and fix as many **security or logic bugs** as possible.
- Explain what each vulnerability is and how you’d mitigate it.

## ⚠️ Important
- Do **NOT** deploy this app publicly — it contains intentionally unsafe code.
- It’s for **local interview use only**.

Good luck, Agent 👾 — Cybernix is watching.
